# hello-world-introduction
Setup repository and General Description
Newbie - Background. Finished highschool in 1975 in NZ so the only programming we did was Pascal and Fortran using punch-cards. A term or two when I was 15 yo or so but enjoyed it.  Punching cards with an unbent paper-clip and then sending the cards away (via the school system) to get them returned four days later with a 'run-time' error was not that encouring I have to say.
Step forward to around 1984 and got a 'portable' computer for work.... a Philips P2000.  'Luggable' we called it but being my first computer I set about using it and with CPM it was a great step forward.  The initial machine had 5 1/2" floppies for booting....but soon got the upgraded version with a single 1.44 MB floppy disk and so the story continues.  Used this machine to 'manage' IEEE devices for the Test&Measurement group which I was part of.
Step forward again to around 2004 and now in Australia I started a very small company (essentially a sales office as part of an international org) and I was it. So in order to get internet, email etc. I became the IT manager (sic).  Bootstrapped myself up and started learning the world of Microsoft on Windows machines and within a couple of years or so we had some 13 staff and my job as 'Administrator' had me installing Microsoft Server, configuring firewalls and fixing the endless problems with distributed user profiles etc.  Please note that I was never 'competent' but put in the hours (after hours) in order to keep it moving until we could afford a 'professional'.
Now 2021 - modern times
I have retired and own a sailing catamaran.  
Have got a some 'bus-related' devices on board and wish to better utilise the data available and perhaps also make some better sailing, management or organisational decisions with assistance from some 'automated' processes. It is also a new skill I wish to learn.

Overview of onboard devices
Raymarine STng and ST (Raymarines proprietory NMEA2000 implementation) for navigation;  Victron Energy power and power management (I will put up a list of exactly what but essentiallly VenusGX (Linux opensource);  Yanar 75 hp diesel engines (pre-bus architecture).
Computing - Only have Apple these days - trying to limit how much 'sys-admin' I need to do so bit the bullet and generally have numerous iOS and MacOS products on board.  In the next few days (circa 3 Feb 2021) will be the proud of a RaspberryPi4+.

At this point I have made some decisions.  It is my attempt to leverage off the work already done by so many people who are experts in this field and/or who have put in the hard yards to 'automate' the crusing sailboat environment.  I am looking, when more competent and with something to offer, to contribute back to this community.  Decisions [poor, misinformed or otherwise and these] are:
  - using python3 (have made a 1st pass read of PEP8 Style Guide)
  - installed Pycharm (IDE), Python3 on MacBook Pro (mid 2015) and now setting up this github repository.
